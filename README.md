The purpose of this project was to create a blog site.

## Description

The blog site should have at least the following pages:
-	Home page
-	About page
-	List of blog posts
-	Blog post specific pages
-	Contact page.

There were also some requirements:
- The home page should feature a 'Latest Posts' section, designed as a carousel (slider) for the desktop version.
- The blog posts page should show the first 10 blogs, and the user should click to view more results which then show underneath the first 10 blogs.
- The content of the blog specific page should be dynamically built using a query string parameter based on whatever link the user clicked.
- The title of the blog specific page should change based on the blog that has been clicked on e.g. “My Blog | An Article I Wrote”.
- If images on the blog specific page are clicked, a modal should appear giving the user a bigger view of that image. Clicking outside the image should hide the modal.
- The content for the website must be stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS.

In the contact page, there should be 4 textboxes with these criterias:
-	Name (Should be more than 5 characters long)
-	Email address (Must be a valid email address)
-	Subject (Should be more than 15 characters long)
-	Message content (Should be more than 25 characters long)

I had to use JavaScript for validation of the Form, and to show error messages if the values in the textboxes do not meet the requirements.
