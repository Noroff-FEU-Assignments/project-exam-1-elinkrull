The purpose of this project was to create a blog site.

## Description

The blog site should have at least the following pages:
-	Home page
-	About page
-	List of blog posts
-	Blog post specific pages
-	Contact page.

There were also some requirements:
- The home page should feature a 'Latest Posts' section, designed as a carousel (slider) for the desktop version.
- The blog posts page should show the first 10 blogs, and the user should click to view more results which then show underneath the first 10 blogs.
- The content of the blog specific page should be dynamically built using a query string parameter based on whatever link the user clicked.
- The title of the blog specific page should change based on the blog that has been clicked on e.g. “My Blog | An Article I Wrote”.
- If images on the blog specific page are clicked, a modal should appear giving the user a bigger view of that image. Clicking outside the image should hide the modal.
- The content for your website must be stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS.
- You will need to add at least 12 blogs for your website. You can use lorem ipsum for paragraphs if you need, but headings, images etc. should all make sense.

In the contact page, there should be 4 textboxes with these criterias:
-	Name (Should be more than 5 characters long)
-	Email address (Must be a valid email address)
-	Subject (Should be more than 15 characters long)
-	Message content (Should be more than 25 characters long)

I had to use JavaScript for validation of the Form, and to show error messages if the values in the textboxes do not meet the requirements.
